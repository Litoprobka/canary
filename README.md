# A very WIP programming language

An unnamed (as of yet) Haskell-like programming languge

There's no concrete plan for the language. For the most part, I'm just figuring out how compilers work.

## What is implemented

- a parser that supports 90% of the syntax
- name resolution

## What is lacking

- typechecker (next priority; I'm probably going with bidirectional type checking)
- compilation to [HVM-lang](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/hvm-lang/)
- support for modules, namespacing, imports, etc.
- pretty much everything else
